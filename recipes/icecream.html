        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
			<li>Milk</li>
			<li>Cream</li>
			<li>Ice</li>
			<li>Salt</li>
			<li>Flavourings (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
			<li>Mix 2 parts milk to 1 part cream into a bowl</li>
			<li>Put that bowl into a larger bowl filled with ice and salt (as salt decreases the freezing temp of water)</li>
			<li>Mix with an electric beater until the mixture begins to firm up</li>
			<li>Add any flavourings you want at this stage</li>
			<li>Put mixture into freezer for at least 2 hours, but up to a day if possible</li>
			<li>Take mixture out and mix it again</li>
			<li>Your icecream is now ready to be served. It will be closer to soft-serve in consistency so keep that in mind for applications</li>
